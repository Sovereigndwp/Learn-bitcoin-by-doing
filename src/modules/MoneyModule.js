        text: `Money is something we use every day, but have you ever wondered why we use certain things as money and not others? ðŸ’­ Imagine trying to buy coffee with mangoes, or pay rent with seashells! Some things work better as money than others.

But money isn't just for spending now â€” it's also how we store the value of our work. ðŸ’ª Imagine working all day and getting paid â€” you might want to buy something *today*, or save up for something bigger *tomorrow*. For that to work, money has to hold its value.

In this module, we'll:
- Explore what qualities make good money
- Test different things as money
- Discover why some money lasts while others fail
- See how Bitcoin fits into the story of money

Get ready to challenge your assumptions about what makes good money!`
