        <p>
          Imagine waking up in a world without money.<br/>
          Not the "I'm broke" kind...<br/>
          The "money doesn't exist at all" kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          You want üëü.<br/>
          Someone else wants ü•ñ.<br/>
          Another person needs their üíßüè† fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless you magically find someone who wants what you have and has what you need, you're stuck staring at your pile of‚Ä¶ whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is called the double coincidence of wants... basically, the universe's least efficient matchmaking system.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's like a dating app, but for bartering:<br/>
          You have shoes.<br/>
          You need bread.<br/>
          You swipe through a sea of people until... boom! Someone finally wants shoes and has sourdough. Good luck with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without money:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trading is painfully slow</li>
          <li>Saving is a gamble (potatoes don't age well)</li>
          <li>And everyone argues over whether a cow is worth three goats or just a sincere thank-you note</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Eventually, humanity got tired of playing this awkward game of economic Tinder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter: <AnimatedIcon type="money" className="bounce" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Some brilliant (or just really frustrated) soul finally said,<br/>
          "What if we just agree on something we can all trade for everything else?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And poof... money was born.<br/>
          A tool to grease the wheels of trade,<br/>
          save value for later,<br/>
          and make deals without needing a PhD in goat valuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because deep down, humans are problem solvers...<br/>
          Even if most of our solutions just lead to new arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what exactly did money fix?
