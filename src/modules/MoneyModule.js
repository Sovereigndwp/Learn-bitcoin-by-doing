      <h2>Imagine a World Without Money</h2>
      <div className="content-text">
        <p>
          Imagine waking up in a world with no money.<br/>
          Not the "I'm broke" kind of no money‚Äîthe "money doesn't even exist" kind.<br/>
          You want üëü.<br/>
          Someone else wants ü•ñ.<br/>
          Another person needs their üíßüè† fixed.<br/>
          Unless you miraculously find someone who wants exactly what you have and has exactly what you need, you're stuck staring at your pile of‚Ä¶ whatever it is you have.<br/>
          This is called the double coincidence of wants‚Äîand it's basically the universe's way of testing your patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But wait! Even if you do manage to barter, your extra food spoils before you can trade it, and nobody can agree if a üêî is worth a ü™ë or just a really nice üé©.<br/>
          So without money, trade is slow, saving is risky, and everyone ends up arguing over whether a üêÑ is worth three üêê or a heartfelt "handshake." 
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Stone Age of economics, where value is in the eye of the beholder, and the barter system is the original dating app for stuff.<br/>
          (And just like dating, it's complicated, often messy, and rarely ends well for anyone involved.)
        </p>

        <h4>Then Along Came Money (Because Barter Was Driving Everyone Nuts)</h4>
        <p>
          So, after centuries of awkward bartering‚Äîthink "Sorry, I don't need your <AnimatedIcon type="chicken" />, but do you want to trade for this slightly used <AnimatedIcon type="spear" />?"‚Äîpeople got creative.<br/>
          They realized that if everyone agreed on something as a "medium of <AnimatedIcon type="exchange" />," life could be a whole lot easier.<br/>
          Enter: <AnimatedIcon type="money" className="bounce" />.
        </p>
        <p>
          And just like that <AnimatedIcon type="magic" />, money transformed the way people traded, saved, and valued things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>No more double coincidence of wants: Now you can sell your <AnimatedIcon type="shoes" /> to anyone and buy <AnimatedIcon type="bread" /> from anyone else.</li>
          <li>Saving is suddenly possible: Extra food spoils, but <AnimatedIcon type="coins" />? They last forever (or at least until you lose them in the <AnimatedIcon type="couch" />).</li>
          <li>Everyone agrees (sort of) on value: Instead of arguing if a <AnimatedIcon type="sheep" /> is worth a basket of <AnimatedIcon type="apples" /> or a night out, you just slap a <AnimatedIcon type="pricetag" /> on it.</li>
        </ol>
