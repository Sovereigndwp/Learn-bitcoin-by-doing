# Learning Progression Analysis: Money → Bitcoin Fundamentals

## Current State Assessment

### Issues Identified:

1. **REDUNDANT OPENINGS**: Both modules start with "broken money system" messaging
2. **WRONG SEQUENCE**: Bitcoin solutions presented before money foundations
3. **MISSING HISTORICAL ARC**: Incomplete money evolution story
4. **WEAK TRANSITIONS**: No logical bridge between modules
5. **INCOMPLETE CONTEXT**: Missing global USD impact, third-world perspective, debt spirals

3. Enhance Bitcoin "Promise" conclusion
4. Add transition bridging between modules

### **Phase 3: Polish & Flow (Week 3)**

4. Optimize emotional pacing

## Success Metrics

Students completing both modules should:
1. **Understand** money's evolution from barter → gold → fiat → Bitcoin
2. **Feel** emotional investment in sound money
3. **Recognize** Bitcoin as inevitable solution
4. **Appreciate** why Bitcoin specifically solves fiat problems
