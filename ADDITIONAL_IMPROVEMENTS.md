      correct: 0,
      explanation: "Private keys are the only way to access your Bitcoin. If lost, the Bitcoin becomes permanently inaccessible."
    }
  ],
  nextReview: Date.now() + (3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 3 days
};

    mentors: ["Experienced community members"]
  },
  "developer_guild": {
    description: "Building on Bitcoin",
    activities: ["Code reviews", "Technical discussions", "Project showcases"]
  }
};
```

#### Peer Mentoring:
